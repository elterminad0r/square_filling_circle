# square\_filling\_circle
Squares that fill up the area of a circle, inspired by the classic pi paradox. It uses a real beauty of an equation worked through by hand to find the intersection of a line with gradient 1 and a circle arc - 

    intercept = 0.5 * (sqrt(-a * a + 2 * a * (b + c - d) - b * b - 2 * b * c + 2 * b * d - c * c + 2 * c * d - d * d + 2 * r * r) + a + b + c - d) - c;

Here is a screenshot of it in action:
